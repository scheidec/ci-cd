## Overview

- Continuous Integration (CI) vs Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD):
    - *What* does each mean?
    - *Who* uses it?
    - *Why* should we use it?
    - *When* is it useful?
    - *Where* and *How* can we implement it in our projects?

- Examples 
    - GitLab CI

---

## Background

- Apps, teams, and infrastructure grow in complexity
    - software development becomes complicated

- Need to manage and automate these processes as quickly and consistently as possible

- Incorporating strategies into software development practices can help
    - Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD)
        - All rely on automated tests to determine the efficacy and correctness of each code change
      
---

## Workflow

![](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/img/cicd_pipeline_infograph.png)

---

## Continuous Integration (CI)

- Integrating code into a shared repository
    - compiles your code on a _per commit_ basis
    
- Automated building and testing
    - allows teams to work on a project together more efficiently
    - detect bugs earlier

---

## Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD)

- Continuous Delivery
    - Automates the steps between checking the code into the repository and deciding whether to release the build
    - builds to the point that the software can be released to production
        - does _not_ automatically deploy

- Continuous Deployment
    - the final step
    - automatic deployment of each build that passes the full test cycle to _production_

---

## CD: Staging vs Production

- Makes the most sense to set up in any projects where we have a _production_ environment
    - where a client or general audience will see our work
        - i.e. shiny apps, blog, website

- Why do we need staging?
    - We want to simulate the production environment to see how our code changes without the end user seeing the changes until they are approved

- Once tests pass and changes are approved in the staging environment, can be manually or automatically pushed to production

---

## Who uses CI/CD?

- Anyone building software
    - Us!
        - Building R packages
        - Creating docker containers
        - Updating the blog/website
        - shiny apps

---

## Why should we use CI/CD?

- Makes our life easier
    - can make code review more efficient
    - more confidence in our code working properly

- Automated testing 

---

## When is CI/CD useful?

- CI
    - Automatic building of docker containers

    - Writing R packages
        - unit tests of functions
    
    - integration testing of different components of code
        - test that changes do not break existing functionality

- CD
    - Putting our work into a production environment

---

## Where/How do we implement CI/CD?

- We already have CI set up!
    - `groundspeedr` R package
    - Vardon backtest pipeline
    - blog
    
- Any future projects that involve building docker containers, package building, shiny apps, etc.

## Setting up Gitlab CI

- How to set up Gitlab CI in a project
    
    1. add `.gitlab-ci.yml` to the root dir of the repo
    
    2. configure the Gitlab project to use a Runner
        - _Shared Runner_ is easiest
            - Go to project's __Settings -&gt; CI/CD__ and click __Enable shared runners__

---

## What to look for in GitLab
    
- __Pipelines__ page in the project
    - make sure CI pipeline jobs are passing -&gt; green check mark

- If a job fails, look at the logs!

---

## Gitlab CI Example: `groundspeedr`

- https://gitlab.com/methodsconsultants/groundspeed/groundspeedr

- Check out:
    - `.gitlab-ci.yml`
    - Container registry
    - Pipelines/Jobs
  

---

## Setting up GitLab CD

- Add configuration to `.gitlab-ci.yml`
    - add an _environment_

- Environments
    - like tags for CI jobs, describing where code gets deployed
    - deployments are created when _jobs_ deploy versions of code to environments

---

## Setting up GitLab CD

- Example: Setting up a _staging environment_
    - add this to `.gitlab-ci.yml`:

```{}

deploy_staging:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "Deploy to staging server"
  environment:
    name: staging
    url: https://staging.example.com
  only:
  - master
```

- `only: master`
    - only pushes to the master branch will be deployed to the staging environment

---

## Setting up GitLab CD

- Example: Setting up a _production environment_
    - add this to `.gitlab-ci.yml`:

```{}

deploy_prod:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "Deploy to production server"
  environment:
    name: production
    url: https://example.com
  when: manual
  only:
  - master
```

- `when: manual`
    - exposes a play button in GitLab's UI and the `deploy_prod` job will only be triggered if we click that button
        - button can be found in the pipeline, job, environment, and deployment views in GitLab

---

## What to look for in GitLab

- __Pipelines -&gt; Environments__ page
    - information of the last deployment status of an environment
    
    - clicking on the environment will show the full history
        - `Re-deploy` and `Rollback` buttons
            - `Rollback` relaunches the previous job with the previous commit

---

## Gitlab CD Example: `blog`

- https://gitlab.com/methodsconsultants/blog

- Hasn't been set up yet, but imagine setting up a staging and production environment
    - How would we do this?
